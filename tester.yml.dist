# Tester configuration file
#
# Tester uses "convention over configuration" and doesn't require configuration.
# This file exists only to satisfy Infection's config file check.
#
# Tester will automatically:
# - Look for tests in: tests/
# - Use bootstrap file: tests/bootstrap.php
# - Discover test files: *Test.php, *.phpt
#
# For Infection configuration, see infection.json5.dist
